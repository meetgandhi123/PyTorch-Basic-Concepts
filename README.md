# Basic PyTorch Pipline.

1. Design the Model (input, output size)
2. Construct the loss and optimizers
3. Training Loop
  - Forward pass: compute predictions
  - Backward Pass: Gradients
  - Update Weights

## Different ways to load dataset explained in GoogleColab Notebook Number (4). 
1. Using PyTorch inbuilt datasets  
2. Loading dataset from a CSV file 
3. Loading dataset from a single folder with a CSV file that maps image name to the class
4. Loading dataset from multiple folders seperated according to the classes
5. Using HDF5 file for loading dataset.
